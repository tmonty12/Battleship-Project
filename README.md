# Battleship Project
This is the classic Battleship boardgame that can be played either as a text-based game or using a pygame GUI. The user competes against an AI that incoporates the Hunt Algorithm. The algorithm works similar to how a human might play by adding surrounding coordinates to a queue after hitting a target.

Run gui.py to play Battleship
